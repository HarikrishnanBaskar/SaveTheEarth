Thor Odinson is a character portrayed by Chris Hemsworth in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. In the films, Thor is known as the "God of Thunder", and is one of the most powerful of the Asgardians, an alien civilization with long ties to Earth, who are therefore considered by some on Earth to be gods.

The Asgardians have advanced science that seems like magic to people of Earth, as shown by Thor's hammer, Mjölnir, with which can channel Thor's ability to wield lightning. After Mjölnir is destroyed in the events of Thor: Ragnarok, however, Thor himself helps forge Stormbreaker, an axe channeling the Bifrost, allowing him to effectively travel across the universe at will.

Thor's character has borrowed a number of characteristics and story lines from across the fifty-plus year history of the character in Marvel Comics. Unlike his comic book version, however, MCU Thor has no superhero "alter ego".[1]
